The offshore wind farm is scheduled to go online at the end of 2024. Upon commissioning, Baltic Eagle will reach 476 MW of total capacity. “The green electricity from the wind turbines will be used to produce green hydrogen,” said Salzgitter Flachstahl. “Green hydrogen is a core component for Salzgitter AG to produce virtually carbon-neutral steel.”
German Minister of Economics Robert Habeck has announced funding for the SALCOS – Salzgitter Low CO2 Steelmaking transformation program. “As confirmed in this notice, the first development stage of SALCOS will receive around €700 million ($768.6 million) in federal funding and € 300 million from the state government,” said Salzgitter AG. “Taken together with the company’s own funds in excess of €1 billion already approved by Salzgitter AG, financing is now assured for the first development stage of SALCOS which is due to be implemented by the end of 2025.”
RWE and Badenova plan to jointly build a hub to produce, transport, and distribute green hydrogen on the Upper Rhine region in Germany. “With the planned electrolysis plant at the RADAG run-of-river power plant in Albbruck, we will be able to provide green hydrogen here in significant quantities from the end of 2026,” said Sopna Sury, COO Hydrogen for RWE Generation. “The green electricity for this will come from renewable sources in the region.” RWE plans to build an electrolysis plant with a capacity of 50 MW to produce up to 8,000 metric tons of green hydrogen per year. Badenova's infrastructure subsidiary, badenovaNETZE, plans to build a new hydrogen pipeline from Waldshut to Albbruck to reach industrial and transport customers on both sides of the Rhine River.
Mercedes-Benz Special Trucks has presented a prototype of its Unimog multi-purpose vehicle with a hydrogen-powered combustion engine. The project, funded by the German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, has been implemented by 18 industrial and scientific partners since July 2021. A hydrogen-powered combustion engine for the traction drive and all power take-offs “could prove to be a possible alternative drive type for the Unimog,” said Daimler Truck. “As space is limited, the installation of a purely battery-electric drive or hydrogen-based fuel cells would be challenging.” Daimler Truck said it only plans to offer climate-neutral vehicles in Europe, the United States, and Japan by 2039.
The Estonian Hydrogen Association has signed an agreement with Alexela, Eesti Energia, the Port of Tallinn, and the University of Tartu to “officially establish the world’s first nationwide Hydrogen Valley.”

The French energy company said it will connect three large-scale batteries to the high-voltage grid at its own sites in the municipalities of Kallo, Drogenbos, and Vilvoorde.
At the site in Drogenbos, in the Belgian province of Flemish Brabant, Engie will deploy batteries with a combined capacity of 80 MW/320 MWh. It already operates another 6 MW of battery capacity in the province.
Engie also plans to build 100 MW/400 MWh of storage at the site in Kallo, in East Flanders, and 200 MW/800 MWh in Vilvoorde, in the Flemish province of Flemish Brabant.
Engie also currently operates a 1,080 MW pumped hydro storage facility in Belgium – the Coo-Trois-Ponts Hydroelectric Power Station in Trois-Ponts, near Liege. “It played a central role in the Belgian energy mix for more than 50 years,” the company said in a statement.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency, Belgium had an installed PV capacity of 6.9 GW at the end of 2022. Its total renewable energy power generation capacity stood at 13.0 GW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/21/novel-technique-to-recover-100-of-silver-from-cgis-solar-cells/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWEDEN,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"APRIL 21, 2023",Novel technique to recover 100% of silver from CIGS solar cells,"Scientists from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden have shown how to recycle valuable metals like silver (Ag) and indium (In) from flexible CIGS solar cells using mild leaching conditions. They used 15.6 cm2 x 15.6 cm2 flexible CIGS solar cells with an Ag conductive grid and stainless-steel substrate from Swedish PV manufacturer Midsummer AB. Each cell was cut into eight identical pieces and then each sample was cut further into one small and one big piece.
The academics placed the small pieces of the PV cells into perfectly sized digestion containers to obtain the total amount of silver and indium per cell. They placed the bigger piece in leaching containers and filled both kinds of containers with a desired volume of nitric acid (HNO3) solution of a specific concentration. The geometrical surface area to liquid ratio (A:L) was also varied across experiments. The team performed all the experiments at room temperature and with a stirring rate of 200 rpm.
After showing that both silver and indium fully dissolved during digestion, and therefore that the leaching experiments would be conducted with the cells’ complete amount of each element, the scientists set out to test what concentration of nitric acid and what ratio of geometrical surface area to liquid resulted in the highest leaching yields.
Results show that a concentration of nitric acid of two moles and a 1:3 A:L ratio leads to very high recovery rates for silver and indium. After four to six hours of leaching, around 90% of silver is recovered, and after 24 hours the recovery rate hits 100%. Around 20% to 25% of indium is recovered within the first hour of leaching, and the highest yield of 85% is achieved after 28 hours.
“When comparing all the results for the different experimental conditions it can be said that the high yields of Ag and In are always accompanied by high contamination levels from many other elements, with [Zinc] being always present,” the scientists noted, adding that contamination with molybdenum can also be problematic.
They then showed that purer streams can be obtained with a selective leaching process. Using a 0.5 mole nitric acid concentration and A:L ratio of 1:3, the recovery rate of silver reaches about 85% after 24 hours with lower contamination levels. Nevertheless, the recovery rate of indium plummets to only 30%.
The scientists also noted that their method isn’t yet appropriate for industrialization, as the concentrations of silver and indium are too low to be used directly in a feasible purification process using more than 1 gram per liter. “Some means of up-concentrating, for example by a reuse of the same leachate for multiple cells, should be considered for industrialization,” they concluded.
The team shared their findings in “Valuable metal recycling from thin film CIGS solar cells by leaching under mild conditions,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.

However, the situation has improved in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. LevelTen Energy was unable to produce a wind index due to insufficient offers available to anonymize the data.
On the other hand, solar power purchase agreement (PPA) prices in Europe have fallen for the first time in two years, except in Spain. Despite this, solar prices in the first quarter of 2023 were 47% higher than in the first quarter of 2022 and 76% higher than in the first quarter of 2021.
LevelTen Energy blames the price declines on overcoming supply chain difficulties caused by the pandemic and gradually declining inflation. Plácido Ostos, senior energy analyst for Europe at LevelTen Energy, stated that “the fall in natural gas prices and electricity markets is adding downward pressure on developers so that their PPAs remain a competitive option for buyers.”
In Spain, the most active PPA solar market in Europe, prices continue to rise, with a 9.8% increase in the first quarter and a 32.2% increase year-on-year. Ostos added that “competition for PPAs in Spain remains extremely high, putting upward pressure on prices.”
Spain's low-priced solar PPAs have made this country an attractive market, but Greece is now tied with Spain in the number of offers on the LevelTen Energy Marketplace with a 17.9% share. Additionally, Greece is the second country after Spain with the highest prices for solar PPAs. LevelTen Energy notes that a new law in Greece gives connection priority to projects with a PPA.
In its previous report, published in February, LevelTen Energy predicted billions in losses if the European electricity market is reformed. However, the company now says that the European Commission's final energy market reform proposal, published on March 14, considers corporate PPAs as the main tool to reduce energy price volatility.
The proposal requires developers participating in a public tender to reserve a percentage of the generation for sale through a PPA. The Commission also proposes that projects that have already committed part of their generation to a PPA allocate another part of the production to “one or several potential buyers who have difficulties accessing the PPA market, such as small and medium-sized companies.”

The so-called “condensed matter” battery, a type of semi-solid state product with condensed electrolyte and new anode and separator materials, will have an energy density of up to 500 Wh/kg.
At the launch ceremony at the Shanghai auto show, Wu Kai, CATL's chief scientist, said the company was working with unspecified partners to ensure the battery is qualified for aviation use in terms of safety and quality. CATL will also be able to start mass production of the condensed matter battery for electric vehicle uses later this year, Wu added.
The new battery leverages highly conductive biomimetic condensed state electrolytes to improve the conductive performance of the cells and in turn the efficiency of lithium-ion transport, while also boosting the stability of the microstructure.
The condensed matter battery is said to integrate “a range of innovative technologies, including the ultra-high energy density cathode materials, innovative anode materials, separators, and manufacturing processes, offering excellent charge and discharge performance as well as good safety performance,” CATL said.
However, no information has been revealed about the cost of the new cells, or the materials required to make them. A few other specifications, such as charging efficiency, charge/discharge rate, safety ranges, and life cycles, were also missing.
The Chinese battery manufacturer, which produced 37% of the world’s electric-vehicle batteries and 43.4% of energy storage batteries in 2022 for a grand total of 289 GWh, has made groundbreaking product announcements in recent years.
In 2021, CATL rolled out its first generation sodium-ion battery with an energy density of 160 Wh/kg and promised an increase to 200 Wh/kg for the next generation. Earlier this week, it confirmed that Chinese Chery will become the first automaker to use its sodium-ion battery tech.
In 2022, CATL unveiled Qilin battery, the third generation of its cell-to-pack technology, claiming the highest integration level to date. With a record-breaking volume utilization efficiency of 72% and an energy density of up to 255 Wh/kg, Qilin is capable of delivering a range of over 1,000 km and equating to a five-minute hot start and ten minutes of charging to get from 10-80% state of charge.
The series production of Qilin started in March this year. These batteries have already been used in multiple electric vehicles from ZEEKR, AITO, Li Auto, and Geely.
On Tuesday, CATL also announced its targets to achieve carbon neutrality with all its battery manufacturing plants by 2025, and across its battery value chain by 2035.
To achieve this, the company will focus on reducing CO2 emissions in five key areas: mining, raw materials, battery materials, battery manufacturing and battery systems. “For CATL, achieving carbon neutrality is our responsibility, demonstrates our capability, and opens up more opportunities,” said CATL Board Secretary Jiang Li.

The Austrian energy agency, OeMAG, has approved around 90,700 applications coming from homeowners in this year's first round of the rebate scheme for rooftop PV and storage. This number also includes applications left over from the previous year that were resubmitted and is related to PV systems not exceeding 20 kW in size.
Furthermore, the ministry approved another 9,300 applications relating to PV installations with capacities ranging from 20 kW to 1 MW. In addition, there were another 33,000 applications for battery storage systems that were accepted.
The first found of the scheme has a budget of €323 million ($353.9 million). Overall, this year's budget amounts to €600 million.
“It's really good news that so many people are contributing to this. More than 100,000 applications are an absolute record,” Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler said at a press conference on Thursday. “But it also poses a challenge. Now is the time to push for more development in a reasonable way. Other countries have had good experiences with the abolition of VAT. We should discuss that seriously,” the minister continued.
Austria reached 4.2 GW cumulative PV capacity at the end of December. Last year, it deployed around 1.4 GW of solar, most of which thanks to the support provided by the rebate scheme.

Brazil has surpassed 20 GW of distributed-generation solar capacity.  The country had hit the 19 GW mark at the end of March.
According to data from the Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (Aneel), there were over 1.8 million distributed-generation PV systems connected to the Brazilian grid across 5,526 municipalities as of April 20, 2023, supplying 2.4 million consumer units. Of the total 20.444 GW of distributed generation, 20.186 GW comes from solar generation.
São Paulo (2.741 GW), Minas Gerais (2.653 GW), Rio Grande do Sul (2.131 GW), Paraná (1.901 GW), and Santa Catarina (1.392 GW) are the leading states in terms of installed capacity.
Most of the distributed solar generation in Brazil is installed at the consumption site itself, with over 15.6 GW installed across 1.5 million systems supplying energy to the unit where they are installed. Remote self-consumption systems take second place with a total of 4.4 GW across 325,000 installations. In contrast, energy communities only have 109 MW of installed capacity across 4,431 systems.

The Sun Scout Pro features three fully integrated 50 W solar panels that charge a 20 Ah lithium-iron-phosphate (LiFePO4) battery. One of the PV panels is located on top of the robot, while two additional modules are fixed onto a sliding, retractable structure.
“By stripping down the solar module to its essentials and adopting more efficient protective designs in conjunction with our flagship stacked panel configuration, we were able to create lightweight solar panel solutions that are perfect for mobile applications,” the research team says on the product’s website.
The PV system has a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) voltage range between 15 V and 45 V. The MPPT solar charger has an efficiency of over 99% and the maximum solar power input is 400 W. The LiFePO4 battery has a rated voltage of 38,4 V and an energy capacity of 768 Wh. The team claims it features 5,000 charge cycles.
“Assuming that the Sunscout Pro charges its batteries an average of four times per week, which is equivalent to 208 times annually, the guaranteed 5,000 charging cycles would provide up to 24 years of usage,” says the research team.
When the robotic lawn mower’s batteries are low, it slides out its two extra PV panels and tracks the sun for faster recharging. The average battery charging time is four hours at 70% discharge. The device measures 850 mm x 450 mm x 400 mm and weighs 45 kg. Its cutting width is 40 cm and the cutting height is programmable between 25 mm to 75 mm. It mulches grass at a speed of 50 meters per minute, covering an area of 1,200 square meters per charge.
The concept was first developed in 2020 and its feasibility was reportedly confirmed by a Massey University study in 2021. The project underwent prototype testing in December 2022 and a working prototype was completed in January 2023. The Massey University team started setting up assembly lines in New Zealand and Germany in February this year and is now trying to gather customer support through a Kickstarter campaign. If successful, it plans to launch the product in June and start shipments by August.
The products will feature a two-year warranty and cost $,2630 according to the Kickstarter campaign page.

As part of the Biden administration's Investing in America program, the US Department of Energy (DoE) has announced a federal funding opportunity of $250 million to incentivize domestic heat pump manufacturing in the United States. This funding opportunity is the first to be announced since President Joe Biden invoked the Defense Production Act (DPA) in the summer of 2022, authorizing the DoE to increase domestic production of five key clean energy technologies, including electric heat pumps.
The IRA governs the new funding, which will be used to build a clean energy economy, create new manufacturing jobs, and help families save money on their energy bills. Increased use of heat pumps for heating and cooling will lower energy costs for more American families and businesses while creating healthier indoor spaces with American-made clean energy technologies.
“Electric heat pumps offer a cheaper, more reliable option for heating and cooling that isn't prone to dramatic price swings and helps to strengthen the nation's energy independence,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm.
More than 40% of all US energy is consumed in the heating and cooling of buildings, homes, offices, government, and municipal facilities. Heat pumps transfer heat rather than generate heat, making them applicable across all climates without reliance on home heating oil, gas, or other fuel sources. One downside to heat pumps has been their poor performance in cold climates. To advance the technology, the DoE launched the Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge. Rheem recently announced an air-source heat pump that passed the Heat Pump Challenge, providing uninterrupted heating under -22.9 F ambient conditions.
The DoE is accepting applications from manufacturers interested in creating new US facilities or expanding existing production capacity to develop more electric heat pump systems, components, and materials. The department seeks projects that will:
Concept papers, required by all applicants, are due by May 19, 2023, 5 p.m. (ET). Full applications are due by Aug. 1, 2023, 5 p.m. (ET).

As one of the first German / European PV module producers, Soluxtec is now ready to follow the strong demand of its customers for a high-class PV module that’s made in Germany.
At the beginning of Q4 in 2022, Soluxtec had already started to consider a switch from PERC to n-type PV modules. “In the same way, we have been the first PV module manufacturer in Germany, having been able to offer to our customers M10 Half Cut Cells beginning in September 2021. We are pleased to again be one of the first – if not even the first one – in Germany offering n-type TOPCon modules from this month on to our partners,” explains Soluxtec CEO Tim Leutert.
Soluxtec
“All the production lines of Soluxtec´s Factory 2 have been switched to offer our customers the latest development, letting our partners enjoy an efficiency of more than 22% for the first time. Higher efficiencies are expected within the next months,” said Soluxtec CTO Julien Zanini. “For me, it was clear already in Q4 of 2022 that we needed to provide a product with higher efficiency and better LCOE than the current standard in the PV industry,” he added.
More than 500MW in year 2023
Soluxtec expects a volume of more than 500MW in 2023 from its Factory 2, which is expected to lead to better prices compared with current European PERC production. The volume is available through Soluxtec’s historical distribution partners.
The company says its challenge was to find an attractive balance between prices, efficiency, and “Made in Germany” production for the new product, as the obsolete PERC p-type technology no longer has a future.
DMMXSCNi offers a favorable LCOE
“There are so many differences that make n-type modules better compared to PERC,” explains Zanini. He adds that in addition to a higher efficiency, a better warranty performance, and the fact that the modules are not susceptible to Light Induced Degradation, the company’s partners will have a chance to enjoy the state-of-the art in the mainstream solar industry.
The outlook for Soluxtec
The company confirms that it will be making a new investment of about 1GW in n-type solar cell technology in order to meet the high demand for solar solutions “Made in Germany” for Europe and the United States in 2024. Soluxtec is currently benchmarking the upcoming trends, such as HJT or IBC back contact cells, either by modifying the company’s existing Factory 1 or by establishing a new Factory 3.

Most solar panels are made from silicon, a well-tested semiconductor material that is not without limitations. For example, silicon loses up to 40% of the energy it collects from sunlight in the form of heat waste. Researchers at Colorado State University are studying radical new ways to improve solar power and provide more options for the future.
Colorado State University chemists are proposing to make solar cells using an abundantly available natural material called molybdenum disulfide. Using a combination of photoelectrochemical and spectroscopic techniques, the researchers conducted a series of experiments showing that extremely thin films of molybdenum disulfide display unprecedented charge carrier properties that could someday drastically improve solar technologies.
The experiments were led by chemistry Ph.D. student Rachelle Austin and postdoctoral researcher Yusef Farah. Austin works jointly in the labs of Justin Sambur, associate professor in the Department of Chemistry, and Amber Krummel, associate professor in the same department. Farah is a former Ph.D. student in Krummel’s lab. Their work is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Sambur’s lab became interested in molybdenum sulfide as a possible alternative solar material based on preliminary data on its light absorption capabilities even when only three atoms thick, explained Austin.
The collaboration made use of Sambur’s expertise in solar energy conversion using  nanoscale materials, and Krummel’s expertise in ultrafast laser spectroscopy, both of which helped them understand how different materials are structured and how they behave.
Krummel’s lab contains a state-of-the-art ultrafast pump-probe transient absorption spectrometer that can very precisely measure the sequential energy states of individual electrons as they are excited with a laser pulse. Experiments using this spectrometer can provide snapshots of how charges flow in a system.
Austin created a photoelectrochemical cell using a single atomic layer of molybdenum sulfide, and she and Farah used the pump-probe laser to track the cooling of electrons as they moved through the material. What they found was astoundingly efficient light-to-energy conversion. More importantly, the laser spectroscopy experiments enabled them to show why this efficient conversion was possible.
What they learned was that the material could convert light to energy so well because its crystal structure allows it to extract and exploit the energy of so-called hot carriers, which are highly energetic electrons that are briefly excited from their ground states when hit with enough visible light. The researchers found that in their photoelectrochemical cell, the energy from these hot carriers was immediately converted into photocurrent, as opposed to being lost as heat, which gave it an advantage over conventional silicon solar cells.
“This work paves the way for knowing how to design reactors that contain these nanoscale materials for efficient and large-scale hydrogen production,” Sambur said.
The project was a collaboration with Professor Andrés Montoya-Castillo and Dr. Thomas Sayer of University of Colorado Boulder, who contributed theoretical chemistry and computational modeling to help explain and verify the experimental data.
“The discovery required a ‘team science’ approach that brought together many different types of expertise, in computational, analytical and physical chemistry,” Krummel said.

Market sentiment for the raw material turned more subdued in recent weeks, ahead of new capacity additions.
China’s new polysilicon manufacturers are expected to add a total of 150 GW of polysilicon output during the third and fourth quarter of the year, the impact of which industry players said would inevitably spill over into international markets. The price of mono-grade polysilicon in China has already fallen for eight consecutive weeks, reaching an 11-week low of CNY 189.93 ($27.58)/kg on April 18 (see chart), according to OPIS data.

Free On Board (FOB) China wafer prices, meanwhile, continued to largely trade sideways, with Mono M10 eking out a 0.12% on-week gain to $0.831/pc. G12 remained unchanged on-week at $1.041/pc on April 18.
Low inventories coupled with tightness in high-purity quartz (HPQ), which is used to make expendable crucibles critical to the wafer manufacturing process, have buffered the wafer sector against weakness in the upstream polysilicon market.
The recent arrival of HPQ imports in China should help to ease some of the manufacturing bottlenecks, but any resulting respite would be unevenly distributed, as most of the imports were bought by the few major wafer makers, sources have said.

The researchers only focused on total installed costs and did not analyze data related to lifetime or running costs, nor to wider energy system costs or benefits. They collected over 550 individual data points across three main categories of cost metrics: single-year cost, experience rate (cost trends), and percentage cost reduction. Although the cost trends analysis obtained a significant amount of data from outside the UK, the single-year cost and percentage cost reduction data mainly concentrate on the United Kingdom.
The results for percentage cost reduction data reveal median average reduction values of 20% for total installed costs by 2030, 31% for non-equipment costs, and 17% for equipment costs.
Single-year installed cost results show that total installed costs have remained relatively stable over time, with very modest declines on average between 2010 and 2030 for both air-source and ground-source heat pumps. The study puts the value for air-source heat pumps at 5%, but it doesn’t mention the exact value for ground-source heat pumps. The median value cost reduction from the early 2020s to the early 2030s is estimated to be around 24%, from €11,000 ($12,000) to €8,400 for air-source heat pumps, and from €16,700 to €15,700 for ground-source heat pumps.
According to its Heat and Buildings Strategy, the UK government aims to reduce the costs of installing a heat pump by at least 25% to 50% by 2025. It is also targeting cost parity between heat pumps and gas boilers by 2030 for overall buying and running costs.
The authors of the report estimate that achieving cost parity in air-source heat pump installed costs would require a 70% reduction, assuming a current cost of GBP 3,000 ($3,730) for gas boilers and GBP 10,000 for air-source heat pumps.
“A reduction in total installed costs of 70% by 2030 is over three times greater than the median average percentage cost reduction forecast in our review of 20%, and almost double the highest single figure of 38%,” the researchers said.
However, they noted that expanding heat pump grants and loans like the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to cover most UK installations can significantly reduce this gap, bringing down the required percentage cost reduction to achieve cost parity to around 40%.

Germany’s Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) has reported that 944 MW of new PV systems were registered in March. The figure marks a significant increase from February, when new additions hit 746 MW, and slight growth from March 2022, when newly installed PV capacity reached 916 MW.
In the first three months of this year, newly installed PV capacity hit 2.65 GW, from around 1.97 GW in the same period a year earlier.
Around 598 MW of the PV capacity deployed in the first quarter of the year was installed in the southern state of Bavaria. North Rhine-Westphalia ranked second with 397.6 MW, followed by Baden-Württemberg with 380.8 MW.
By the end of March, Germany's cumulative installed PV capacity had reached 70.1 GW. In order to reach its 2030 solar target of 215 GW, the country needs to add at least 1.55 GW of new solar every month.
